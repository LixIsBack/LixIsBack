Bells come fat, Big Narstie
Step in the 2 leave everything nasty (Splash)
Step in the vibe, Bully B got bine
Be nice, 'cah gang love locking off parties (Bow)
G-check yutes, don't care if I'm rude
ND needs to know if you're good like Lani
Splashed up Natz in front of his barbie
Insert that and twist like car keys
Wish I had mine when Ramz got slapped
Gang put a boy to sleep, LOL, donny had more than a nap (Dead)
Bones gon' crunch like Pringles (Ching)
I see donny just got his hair done
Spin it and fling it at my man singles (Bow)
Really tryna leave man crippled (Bow)
Folks don't know how to bruck that dots
Ay, pass it my nigga, it's simple
Didn't your friend get slapped by the pistol
I was in the kwayest spot, no pimple 'til I got put in a cell, no sickle

My runner got nicked with my pack and a Rambo
So he's in the bando scrapin' prof'
He put the whole thing under the water
Now I'm at the pyrex, savin' Josh
Bully B, I took L's but I made it back
You ain't really in the trap if you ain't taking loss
Twelve wraps for a 9 of yola
No mediocre youngest boss
In the 9 where four got shanked
So I gotta give thanks to my window smasher
Mumzy still tryna ask what I do
I told her "I'm a full time rapper"

This wap gettin' rose like Amber
No banter if I press this heater
What you know about 5-man glides?
Man lean out the ride, 4-door, two litre
Federales tryna stop this beamer
Gave the nina to my caramel diva
.44 in my hand like Lisa
Turn the Tina, let it sing, Dua Lipa
Shotgun spread, you can catch this fever
Add thems K's you can feel this fire
This spin ting got range like Rover
Flings my shoulder and burn my attire
Tell a sweet one "come lock this fryer"
I'll collect it when I pattern a buyer
Man shoot, Van Persie
Want mercy? Best ask the Messiah

ND, I don't play no games
I don't play no games like Nintendo Switch
I'll air this blick for J
Man won't stop till the blick goes click
He was gang but now he switched
Oh well, I ain't gonna cry like a bitch
My old friend turnt into a snitch
Snake, what can I say?
Blast my man out his Jays
If you think you could still be addin' a K
This one sound like grenades
Bones gon' break if it hits your mates
Free Trill wicked, free Shotty Shane
I get nicked I don't say no names
She said that the (22) boys are lame
He didn't die got me thinkin' "how?"
Bow, this corn is loud
I pray that this corn here hits man's scalp
D1, my slime, my pal
Gimme the ting, I'ma slide right now
This bluefoot came from South
She left my block with kids in her mouth
My old friend turnt into a mouse
